The availability of huge amounts of data has led to the emergence of AI in different fields. The emergence of AI has made significant changes in the healthcare industry from drug discovery to medical imaging and therapeutics. Except for one thing that is left unexplored: neonatology. 

In the Neonatal Intensive Care Units(NICU) the newborns require intense care and monitoring. If we did not attend to the needs of neonatal babies during an unexpected abnormal condition it could lead to fatal decomposition. Thus constant monitoring of neonates in NICU is an absolute must. Traditional methods involve an attendant being physically present to record the vital signals.

The presence of wired sensors for monitoring vital signs causes heavy discomfort among the newborns. Thus in our AI powered monitoring system we aim to develop an application which records infant vital signs like respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), temperature (T), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation level (SpO2) using sensors. Hence we also reduce the manpower and make the NICU very resource efficient.
 
By using machine learning and deep learning technologies we can predict potential health deteriorations like the detection of a drop in SpO2 levels, which indicates a need for immediate oxygen therapy to prevent serious complications. The project uses a cloud-based storage that allows healthcare professionals to access real-time data remotely, facilitating immediate responses to emergencies. The system's design prioritises user-friendliness for clinicians and caregivers, ensuring that alerts regarding abnormal readings or significant changes in activity patterns are promptly communicated. This proactive approach not only supports timely medical interventions but also enhances the overall efficiency of neonatal care.
